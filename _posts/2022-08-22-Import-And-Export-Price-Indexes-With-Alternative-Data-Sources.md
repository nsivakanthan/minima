In Summer 2022, I had the opportunity to work remotely at the Bureau of Labor Statisitcs as a Data Science Fellow through Coding It Forward. I worked in the International Pricing Program under Dominic Smith, PhD. 

At the end of the fellowship experience, I gave an online presentation to the Department of Labor over one of the projects I worked on over the summer. Included here is the slide deck of that presentation:
